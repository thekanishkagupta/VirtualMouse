# Virtual Mouse
User hand can be used as a virtual mouse and can do everything that a mouse does, without even touching the system.

The Virtual Mouse provides an infrastructure between the user and the system using only a camera. It allows users to interact with machines without the use of physical devices, and even control mouse functionalities.

## How to use Virtual Mouse
The fore finger will act as a cursor and user can move it around. Now, inorder to successfully click using hand tracking, join the fore finger and the middle finger together as it is detecting the distance between the fore finger and the middle finger.

* OpenCV is a great tool for image processing and performing computer vision tasks. It is an open-source library that can be used to perform tasks like face detection, objection tracking, landmark detection, and much more.

* Mediapipe is a cross-platform library developed by Google that provides amazing ready-to-use ML solutions for computer vision tasks.

The mediapipe library finds 21 different landmarks on the hand as shown below.
